RvG (Red vs Green) is a simple minecraft minigame based off of the same minigame from the retired server, "let's hang mc".

The premise of the game is to capture multiple different control points, earning points for your team the longer you control said points. Once a team reaches a certain amount of points, the game is over.

You can use different classes and buy both cosmetic and useful upgrades with coins (currency gained by playing the game, and not purchasable with real money).
